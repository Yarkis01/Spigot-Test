# Spigot-Test
A simple Minecraft plugin to discover the possibilities offered by Spigot.

This plugin is in no way intended for production. Its purpose is just to contain all the stupid add-ons that allow me to discover the Java language and the Spigot library. The plugin code is not optimised and is really bad.

The plugin has been coded for Minecraft 1.14
